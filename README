Setup process:

This is the backend repository, first clone the repository or download the zip file.

You need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project, use the dotenv_template as a reference.
The provided database name should be created beforehand, and the user should have all the privileges on the database.
The backend will create the required collections if they don't exist.

Run the following commands to install the dependencies and start the server:
npm install
npm start

The server will start on port 3001 by default, if no port specified in the env file.

Now you can move to the frontend repository and follow the instructions there.

You can use "npm run dev" to start the server in development mode, which will restart the server on every change.
